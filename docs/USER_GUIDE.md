# Tidy UI - Game Settings: User Guide

Tidy UI - Game Settings is a module for Foundry VTT that enhances the game settings and module management interfaces. This guide will help you understand and utilize the various features provided by the module.

## Core Features

The module automatically reorganizes the layout of the "Settings" tab and "Manage Modules" window for improved usability and visual clarity.

### Module Management Simplification

When you open the **Manage Modules** window, you will notice several new interaction options at the top:

1. **Check All / Uncheck All Buttons:**
   - **Check All:** Enables all modules installed on your server for the current game.
   - **Uncheck All:** Disables all modules *except* for "Tidy UI - Game Settings" and "Tidy UI" (if installed). This acts as a safe reset, ensuring you do not lock yourself out of the Tidy UI interface.

2. **Hide "Disable All" Button:**
   - If you frequently misclick the default Foundry VTT "Deactivate All" button and wish to hide it, Tidy UI offers a setting for that.
   - Go to **Game Settings > Configure Settings > Tidy UI - Game Settings** and check "**Hide 'Deactivate All' Button**".

### Settings Sidebar Overhaul

In the **Configure Settings** menu:

- The settings are grouped more logically, making navigation intuitive.
- Individual module settings start in a *collapsed* state.
- You can expand only the modules you are currently configuring, which significantly reduces scrolling on servers with many modules.
- **Easy Checkboxes:** You can click directly on a setting's label to toggle its associated checkbox, providing a larger click target.

## Module Import/Export

The module allows you to easily share and backup your active module configuration using the Export and Import features located in the **Manage Modules** window.

### Exporting Your Configuration

1. Open the **Manage Modules** window.
2. Click the **Export** button (indicated by a file export icon) at the top.
3. A modal will open displaying the current state of both your **Active** and **Inactive** modules.
4. **Options:**
   - **To Clipboard:** Copies the formatted text list of active and inactive modules to your clipboard, useful for sharing in text form on Discord or forums.
   - **To File:** Downloads a `moduleList.json` file. This file contains the structured JSON data necessary to import this exact module configuration into another game or server.

### Importing a Configuration

*Warning: Importing a configuration will overwrite your currently active modules. Ensure you have backed up your current configuration if needed.*

1. Open the **Manage Modules** window.
2. Click the **Import** button (indicated by a file import icon) at the top.
3. **Options:**
   - **From File:** Select a `moduleList.json` file you previously generated via the Export to File option.
   - **Activate:** If you already copied the JSON output from an export, you can paste it into the provided text area and click "Activate".
4. The module will parse the data and automatically check all the modules listed in the JSON's `activeModules` array, unchecking everything else.
5. You **must click "Save Module Settings"** at the bottom of the window to apply the changes.

### Troubleshooting

- **Import Error "Missing activeModules array":** The data you provided (either via file or paste) is missing the structural requirements generated by an official Tidy UI export. Ensure you are importing an unmodified `moduleList.json`.
- **Importing text vs JSON:** The text list generated by "To Clipboard" is for readability and human sharing. It cannot be used in the Paste area for "Activate". You must use the raw JSON text for pasting, or use the "From File" option with a generated JSON file.
