# Tidy UI - Game Settings

This is a standalone module, formerly known as "FVTT UII - Game Settings," designed to improve the usability and comfort of the game settings menus within Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

#### Key Features:

* **Reorganized Settings Sidebar:** Buttons are grouped by function to make them more intuitive and less confusing.
* **Improved Layout:** Input fields, buttons, and other elements are better aligned with improved spacing for easier reading and navigation.
* **Enhanced Module Manager:**
    * Includes a button to toggle the visibility of module information, making it faster to browse and manage installed modules.
    * Provides "check all" and "uncheck all" functionality for modules (the Tidy UI module itself will remain checked).
* **Collapsible Module Settings:** In the Settings Tab, individual module settings start collapsed. You can expand only the ones you need, preventing endless scrolling.
* **Easier Interaction:** You can click on the title of a setting to toggle its checkbox.
* **Alphabetical Sorting:** All modules in the Module Manager and the Settings Tab are sorted alphabetically by their display name.

#### Supported Game System:
* The description states that it currently supports the **dnd5e** game system.
