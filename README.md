# Tidy UI - Game Settings

A comprehensive Foundry VTT module that enhances the usability and visual clarity of the game settings interface, making configuration management more intuitive and efficient.

## Features

### Reorganized Settings Sidebar
Settings buttons are logically grouped by function, creating a more intuitive navigation structure that reduces confusion and improves workflow efficiency.

### Improved Visual Layout
Enhanced spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy throughout the settings interface make information easier to scan and interact with. Input fields, buttons, and controls are consistently positioned for better usability.

### Advanced Module Manager
- **Toggle Module Information:** Quickly show or hide module descriptions and details for faster browsing
- **Bulk Selection Controls:** "Check all" and "uncheck all" buttons for rapid module management (Tidy UI itself remains checked for stability)
- **Alphabetical Sorting:** Modules are automatically sorted by display name for easier location

### Collapsible Module Settings
Individual module settings in the Settings Tab start in a collapsed state, allowing you to expand only what you need. This eliminates endless scrolling and makes finding specific settings much faster.

### Enhanced Interactions
Click directly on setting titles to toggle their associated checkboxes—no need to precisely target small checkbox areas.

### Consistent Organization
All modules appear alphabetically sorted in both the Module Manager and Settings Tab, providing a predictable and organized experience.
